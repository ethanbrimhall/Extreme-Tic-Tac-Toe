# Extreme-Tic-Tac-Toe
This is a Tic-Tac-Toe javascript game but instead of winning when you get three in a row, you have to win three game in a row!

The game is played like tic tac toe but there are 9 boards. You can place an 'x' or 'o' in any of the 81 squares. You play each board like a normal tic tac toe game but in order to win the overall game, you must win three tic tac toe boards in a row, like you would win a normal game.
